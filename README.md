# KTerrabase

===== Short Description
KTerrabase (C++) is a Stock Data Simulation program to help users understand how the stock market lives while helping users make decisions based on the state of a stock price and general performance. BETA version / Under development. 

===== Main Description (Instruction / Overview) =====

Before jumping into the program's information, here is an overview of what KTerrabase means and stands for. 
KTerrabase is a learning ground. It holds the general idea of teaching users about the world of technology that we live in. Information Technology, gaming, computer assembly/building, cybersecurity, and more. KTerrabase is not only to be a C++ program that simulates stock data but to give users an understanding of how to become familiar with big topics in tech that are changing the world day after day. 

==== The application can be found here: KTerrabaseProgram/x64/Debug/KTerrabaseProgram.exe

The program in this dedicated repository is named KTerrabaseCPP, a part of the financial data simulation branch in KTerrabase. This project holds the objective to simulate stock data to show users how to read a fluctuating stock price and when/how to act upon it. 

KTerrabaseCPP runs in the command prompt shell line-by-line.

Users will need to either create a new account within the program or log in as an existing user account by username. 
This feature was made with the work of simple file I/O functions and vector(s) to push the newly created (and checked) user profile into a saved file.
(Saved onto a text file so that after running the program again, the code will see existing users for them to log in as. **PLEASE DO NOT USE REAL INFORMATION**)

The simulated data will generate once the user puts in a stock name and its current/starting price when asked to do so.
For example:
--> TSLA
--> $402.66

Once the simulation finishes, a new larger menu will be given and allow the user to view the generated stock price within that year in different time spans such as the final month, the last six months, or the entire year (default). 
Every hour throughout the year holds an average price within its minutes (hours were the perfect unit in size in terms of stack memory being used). 

Users can see more than just the price of each hour. They can also see a large bar graph with each bar having its price next to it. This allows for easy understanding and navigation throughout the year's span shown. 

In addition, the option is available for users to have the program decide when was a good time to buy, sell, or wait on a share at a certain time within the year. This portion of the program is part of the main idea of helping users be more aware of what is happening in the stock market overall. 

** Final Note: KTerrabaseCPP is currently under BETA status and only covers the basics of real-world scenarios. There is a lot to learn and study about the topic of stock trading and the blockchain of cryptocurrency. The program is under development along with its Website counterpart "kterrabase.com". A new section on GitHub will be released with the website's code in the future. Thank you! **
